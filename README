Creare (cray-are-ay) -v (Latin) 1. To create 

Creare is the engine for our local maker, crafter and creator site, Nevada County Makes. It is PRE BETA and is currently full of exploratory false starts, duplication and brain twiddling. No sane person should attempt to use this code for any reason whatsoever until I get a chance to clean it up later this week. Which is not to imply it would be a great idea even then until I've run it for awhile.
