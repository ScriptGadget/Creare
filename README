Creare (cray-are-ay) -v (Latin) 1. To create 

Creare is the engine for our local maker, crafter and creator site, Nevada County Makes. This is currently running without issues for about 43 Makers and over 300 products. It hasn't faced heavy actual load yet, but it performs well in testing.

We're sharing this as an example of what worked for us. There is no warranty express or implied for this work and you use it at your own risk. The Creare code is under GPL3. (Please see COPYING in the same directory as this README file).
